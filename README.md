# Connor Masterson
## ccmaster@ucsc.edu

My name is Connor and I recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Computer Engineering. I also finished my Senior Thesis which is about hardware accelerators for speeding up Multi-Scalar Multiplication in the context of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This work is being done in Chisel. Before this, I worked in the Vertical Architectures, Memories, and Algorithms (VAMA) research group on the Graph Algorithm Platform Benchmark Suite, a suite of benchmarks and implementations of common graph kernels. 

In June of 2022, I will be joining Google as a CPU Design Verification Engineer!
