My name is Connor and I am a Senior Computer Engineering Student at UC Santa Cruz.
I am currently working on a Senior Thesis which is about hardware accelerators for
speeding up Multi-Scalar Multiplication for Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Before this, I
worked with my now advisor on the Graph Algorithm Platform Benchmark Suite.
