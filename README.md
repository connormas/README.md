My name is Connor and I am a Senior Computer Engineering Student at UC Santa Cruz.
I am currently working on a Senior Thesis which is about hardware accelerators for
speeding up Multi-Scalar Multiplication in the context of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. 
This work is being done in Chisel. Before this, I worked with my now advisor
in the Vertical Architectures, Memories, and Algorithms (VAMA) research group on
the Graph Algorithm Platform Benchmark Suite, a suite of benchmarks and implementations
of common graph kernels.
