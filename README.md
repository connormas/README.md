My name is Connor and I recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Computer Engineering. I also finished my Senior Thesis which is about hardware accelerators for speeding up Multi-Scalar Multiplication in the context of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This work was done in Chisel. Before this, I worked in the Vertical Architectures, Memories, and Algorithms (VAMA) research group on the Graph Algorithm Platform Benchmark Suite, a suite of benchmarks and implementations of common graph kernels. 

I am now working at Google as a CPU RTL Engineer.
